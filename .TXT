I created a new frontend project folder called **`loonpay_frontend`**.  
Inside it, I built a **reusable service module** that handles blockchain interactions.  
Specifically, the service is responsible for:
    - Connecting to MetaMask
    - Requesting user wallet access
    - Setting up the **signer** (for sending transactions)
    - Setting up the **provider** (for reading data from the blockchain)
     - Instantiating and exporting a ready-to-use smart contract instance

This setup allows any part of the frontend app to easily interact with the smart contract by simply importing the service, without duplicating connection logic.

PS: does npx hardhat node command work for you?
I normally use yarn 
so you can install it 
and just run "yarn add"
